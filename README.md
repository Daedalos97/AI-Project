# A game playing agent for Moss Side Whist

## Authors
Sam Heath, Andre Wang


## Instructions
The agents are implemented under `game/src/` as `Agent.java` and `AgentTwo.java`. Both implement the `MSWAgent` interface so they can be used as parameters to the `MossSideWhist` constructor.

A sample 'game simulator' is available in `GameSimulator.java`.

It is assumed that the following files are available:

- `MossSideWhist.java` (game definition)
- `Card.java` (card definitions)
- `MSWAgent.java` (the interface)

## Data

Experimental data is available under `data/`.
